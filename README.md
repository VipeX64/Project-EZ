# Project "EZMAT"

For the last few weeks I've been working on this project of mine. The goal of the whole project was to help students with their school preparation. I wanted to ensure, that those people in need of assistance get their help by any means. 

I've developed a free app, where people can learn and improve in their subjects. The whole idea behind this is simple. It's like playing a game or filling out a quiz. 

In year 1651 Jan Ámos Komenský, one of the most important figures in history, released a schoolbook called "__Škola hrou__" (raw translation = Learning by playing). This book explained how it's easy to learn something, just by making it more fun for the one whose learning it. The exact principle is used in my idea. 

Making learning stuff easy, and fun. 

Ladies and gentleman, I present you... __EZMAT__.
